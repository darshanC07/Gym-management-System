# Gym-management-System
This is a Gym management system built in C++. Here, I tried to build it like a real one. It contains two consoles/dashboards, one for the user and one for the admin. The user has a complete guide to the gym, starting from plans to choosing a trainer and also about today's diet and exercise. The admin has all rights to add/remove members and trainers and also create notices and all.
